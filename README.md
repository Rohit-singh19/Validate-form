# Form Validation
Form validation is a “technical process where a web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct.”

If all the inputs are not correctly filled then, it will prevent from submiting the form and it will alert the user that they have not filled the required input boxes.

* If the inputs are blanked then, it will show:

  [input name] can't be blanked.

* If email is incorrectly filled, then it will give an error :

  [Email input] is not valid.

* If Confirm password is not same as password, then it will give an error:

  Passwords are not same.
  
Basically, validation makes sure that the provided text is in the right format (e.g., for email, user@something.com), and if the text fits the qualifications for a suitable entry (e.g., the email isn’t already registered, or the password fits the criteria).
